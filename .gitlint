# By default gitlint will ignore merge, revert, fixup and squash commits.

# This is an example of how to configure the "title-max-length" rule and
# set the line-length it enforces to 80

# Conversely, you can also enforce minimal length of a title with the
# "title-min-length" rule:
[title-min-length]

[title-must-not-contain-word]
# Comma-separated list of words that should not occur in the title. Matching is case
# insensitive. It's fine if the keyword occurs as part of a larger word (so "WIPING"
# will not cause a violation, but "WIP: my title" will.
